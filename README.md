# MongoDB-Database 

## About the Project

The MongoDB Database project is a standard database query program that was developed for my CS-340 class. The program utilizes the Python programming language along with the versatility of the NoSQL MongoDB to create a powerful stack that allows the user to perform CRUD operations on the databases provided. This program uses two .CSV files to create the databases which the program will use to perform the operations. All options are displayed on a main menu, that allows users to easily find the option they are looking for.

## Motivation

This project was originally designed as part of a final project for my CS-340. The project has since been enhanced and serves as an artifact to show my comprehension of database design and proper interaction with them. By revising and adding new features to this program in my CS-499 class, I believe the program now successfully shows my ability and skills creating databases.

## Installation

To properly run this program, Python must first be installed on the users machine.
